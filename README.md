# 🎹 Blazor-Midi-GoKeys

**Blazor-Midi-GoKeys** is an interactive web application built with **Blazor WebAssembly** that allows you to **connect, visualize, and interact with the Roland GO:KEYS musical keyboard**.

This app demonstrates how Blazor can be used to **handle MIDI devices directly in the browser**, combining the power of **C#**, **WebAssembly**, and the **Web MIDI API**.
